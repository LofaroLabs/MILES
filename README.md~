This is the github repository for MILES-Miles Indoor Localization Enhancement System. This is a catkin repository for ROS. This project was designed for ROS Hydro. If another ROS distro is used, MILES may not work properly

There are 5 different folder for MILES. Below are their names and what they contain:


Control:

Contains the ros packages that allow the computer to drive the pioneer3dx.

Mapping:

Contains different packages that allow the computer to interface with different sensors to map the environment and create a 2D map and also collect WIFI Data. If you are not using rgbdslam, you may want to delete the package as it is very large.

MILES:

This is the package that go onto the integrated Computer. For our design we used a Raspberry Pi 2. This includes the Localizer(Reader) and the seriallistener that will listen to serial ports.

MISC:

This contains packages that are used in more than one area. For example, the wifi_scanner package is used in both Mapping and the MILES integrated system.

Navigation:

This contains packages that are used to interface with the MILES device and the pioneer3dx to navigate around.
